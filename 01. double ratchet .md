Instant messaging in messaging apps allows conversations to take place over the internet even when one party’s phone is off or communication is asynchronous. In such situations, there may be long delays, sometimes months, between messages. These delays give attackers more time to break encryption keys and also increase the chance that users forget or lose keys, making messages unreadable. So far, only part of the process has been covered. Pre-key bundles and the initial Triple Diffie–Hellman key exchange are used to establish keys asynchronously. One possible approach is to use that initial key to secure every message, similar to online shopping on the internet. However, this is insecure. If a conversation lasts for months and an attacker records all messages, breaking a single key would expose the entire conversation because the same key is reused. Therefore, the key must be updated continuously instead of being reused.

The key question is how often the encryption key should be updated. Signal, WhatsApp, and the Signal Protocol are strict about this and update the key for every single message. Each message in these applications is encrypted with a different key, which makes it extremely difficult for an attacker to obtain meaningful information. Even if an attacker manages to break one message, they may only be able to read that single message, or at most a few, despite capturing all the traffic. In practice, this usually results in access to only one message. Additionally, the keys themselves are already very hard to break, which makes the overall system extremely difficult to compromise.
